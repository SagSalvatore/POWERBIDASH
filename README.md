# Call Centre Performance Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of call centre performance metrics. It focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as call resolution rates, agent performance, call volume trends, and customer satisfaction ratings. The dashboard is designed to help call centre managers optimize operations, improve agent efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.

---

## Key Features
- **Agent Performance Analysis**: Tracks the number of calls answered, resolved, and rejected by each agent.
- **Call Volume Trends**: Visualizes monthly call volumes to identify peak periods and trends.
- **Resolution Rates**: Displays the percentage of calls resolved versus unresolved.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Highlights average satisfaction ratings and identifies top-performing agents.
- **Call Rejection Analysis**: Tracks the number of calls rejected by agents to identify areas for improvement.
- **Dynamic Filters**: Includes slicers for time periods (e.g., months) and call types (e.g., payment-related, admin support).
