# Call Centre Performance Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of call centre performance metrics. It focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as call resolution rates, agent performance, call volume trends, and customer satisfaction ratings. The dashboard is designed to help call centre managers optimize operations, improve agent efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.
